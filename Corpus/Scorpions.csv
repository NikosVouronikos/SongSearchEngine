10,Scorpions,The Good Die Young,Sting in the Tail,2010,03/19/2010,Out in the fields  the fighting has begun Out on the streets  they're shooting with their guns In the darkest night  out in the pouring rain The true believers stand alone Out in the fields  the fighting has begun Out on the streets  they're shooting with their guns In the darkest night  out in the pouring rain The true believers stand alone And in the distance  out from the raging sea There is a voice that's calling  calling out to me I can hear it when I close my eyes  I can hear it reaching deep inside The good die young  that's what they say But it's hard to justify the price we pay The good die young  that's what they say We'll go on and on and on and on Out in the fields  the fighting has begun Out on the streets  they're shooting with their guns In the darkest night  out in the pouring rain The true believers stand alone And in the distance  out from the raging sea There is a voice that's calling  calling out to me I can hear it when I close my eyes  I can hear it reaching deep inside The good die young  that's what they say But it's hard to justify the price we pay The good die young  that's what they say We'll go on and on and on and on The good die young  that's what they say But it's hard to justify the price we pay The good die young  that's what they say We'll go on and on and on and on And in the distance  out from the raging sea There is a voice that's calling  calling out to me I can hear it when I close my eyes  I can hear it reaching deep inside.

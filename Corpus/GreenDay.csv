1,Green Day,American Idiot,American Idiot,2004,09/20/2004,Don't wanna be an American idiot. Don't want a nation under the new mania. And can you hear the sound of hysteria? The subliminal mind fuck America. Welcome to a new kind of tension. All across the alien nation. Where everything isn't meant to be okay. Television dreams of tomorrow. We're not the ones who're meant to follow. For that's enough to argue.
2,Green Day,Boulevard of Broken Dreams,American Idiot,2004,11/29/2004,I walk a lonely road. The only one that I have ever known. Don't know where it goes. But it's home to me, and I walk alone. I walk this empty street. On the boulevard of broken dreams. Where the city sleeps. And I'm the only one, and I walk alone. My shadow's the only one that walks beside me. My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating. Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me. Till then I walk alone.
3,Green Day,Good Riddance (Time of Your Life),Nimrod,1997,10/14/1997,Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road. Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go. So make the best of this test, and don't ask why. It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time. It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. I hope you had the time of your life. So take the photographs, and still-frames in your mind. Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time. Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial. For what it's worth it was worth all the while.
4,Green Day,21 Guns,21st Century Breakdown,2009,05/25/2009,Do you know what's worth fighting for? When it's not worth dying for? Does it take your breath away and you feel yourself suffocating? Does the pain weigh out the pride? And you look for a place to hide? Did someone break your heart inside? You're in ruins. One, 21 guns. Lay down your arms, give up the fight. One, 21 guns. Throw up your arms into the sky. You and I.
5,Green Day,When I Come Around,Dookie,1995,02/01/1995,I heard you crying loud. All the way across town. You've been searching for that someone. And it's me out on the prowl. As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself. Don't get lonely now, dry your whining eyes. I'm just roaming for the moment. Sleazin' my back yard so don't get so uptight. You've been thinking about ditching me. No time to search the world around. Cause you know where I'll be found. When I come around.

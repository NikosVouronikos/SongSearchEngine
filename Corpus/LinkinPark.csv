1,Linkin Park,Numb,Meteora,2003,03/25/2003,I'm tired of being what you want me to be Feeling so faithless lost under the surface I don't know what you're expecting of me Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes (Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow) Every step that I take is another mistake to you (Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow) And every second I waste is more than I can take I've become so numb I can't feel you there Become so tired so much more aware I'm becoming this all I want to do Is be more like me and be less like you Can't you see that you're smothering me Holding too tightly afraid to lose control 'Cause everything that you thought I would be Has fallen apart right in front of you (Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow) Every step that I take is another mistake to you (Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow) And every second I waste is more than I can take I've become so numb I can't feel you there Become so tired so much more aware I'm becoming this all I want to do Is be more like me and be less like you And I know I may end up failing too But I know you were just like me with someone disappointed in you I've become so numb I can't feel you there Is everything what you want me to be I've become so numb I can't feel you there Is everything what you want me to be.
2,Linkin Park,In The End,Hybrid Theory,2001,10/09/2001,It starts with one thing I don't know why It doesn't even matter how hard you try Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme To explain in due time All I know Time is a valuable thing Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings Watch it count down to the end of the day The clock ticks life away It's so unreal Didn't look out below Watch the time go right out the window Trying to hold on, didn't even know I wasted it all just to watch you go I kept everything inside And even though I tried, it all fell apart What it meant to me will eventually be A memory of a time when I tried so hard And got so far But in the end, it doesn't even matter I had to fall to lose it all But in the end, it doesn't even matter One thing, I don't know why It doesn't even matter how hard you try Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme To remind myself of a time when I tried so hard In spite of the way you were mocking me Acting like I was part of your property Remembering all the times you fought with me I'm surprised it got so (far) Things aren't the way they were before You wouldn't even recognize me anymore Not that you knew me back then But it all comes back to me (in the end) What it meant to me will eventually be A memory of a time when I tried so hard And got so far But in the end, it doesn't even matter I had to fall to lose it all But in the end, it doesn't even matter I've put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go And for all this, there's only one thing you should know I've put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go And for all this, there's only one thing you should know.
3,Linkin Park,Crawling,Hybrid Theory,2000,03/01/2001,Crawling in my skin These wounds, they will not heal Fear is how I fall Confusing what is real There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface Consuming, confusing This lack of self-control I fear is never ending Controlling, I can't seem To find myself again My walls are closing in (Without a sense of confidence and I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take) I've felt this way before So insecure Crawling in my skin These wounds, they will not heal Fear is how I fall Confusing what is real Discomfort, endlessly has pulled itself upon me Distracting, reacting Against my will I stand beside my own reflection It's haunting how I can't seem... To find myself again My walls are closing in (Without a sense of confidence and I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take) I've felt this way before So insecure Crawling in my skin These wounds, they will not heal Fear is how I fall Confusing what is real Crawling in my skin These wounds, they will not heal Fear is how I fall Confusing, confusing what is real There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface Consuming (confusing what is real) This lack of self-control I fear is never ending Controlling (confusing what is real).
4,Linkin Park,Breaking the Habit,Meteora,2003,07/20/2004,Memories consume Like opening the wound I'm picking me apart again You all assume I'm safe here in my room Unless I try to start again I don't want to be the one The battles always choose 'Cause inside I realize That I'm the one confused I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream I don't know why I instigate And say what I don't mean I don't know how I got this way I know it's not alright So I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit Tonight Clutching my cure I tightly lock the door I try to catch my breath again I hurt much more Than anytime before I had no options left again I don't want to be the one The battles always choose 'Cause inside I realize That I'm the one confused I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream I don't know why I instigate And say what I don't mean I don't know how I got this way I'll never be alright So I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit Tonight I'll paint it on the walls 'Cause I'm the one at fault I'll never fight again And this is how it ends I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream But now I have some clarity To show you what I mean I don't know how I got this way I'll never be alright So I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit Tonight
